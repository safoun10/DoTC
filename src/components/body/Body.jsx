					Thermal conduction is the transfer of heat from one part of
					a body to another with which it is in contact. Thermal
					conductivity <span className="fw-bold">Î»</span> is defined
					as ability of material to transmit heat and it is measured
					in watts per square metre of surface area for a temperature
					gradient of 1 K per unit thickness of 1 m. The thermal
					conductivity is{" "}
					<span className="fw-bold">not always constant</span>. The
					main factors affected the thermal conductivity are the
					density of material, moisture of material and ambient
					temperature. With increasing density, moisture and
					temperature the thermal conductivity increases too.

						{" "}
						Important thing is the inner structure of materials.
					</span>{" "}
					Metals and other dense solid materials tend to have high
					levels of conductivity, whereas materials with very small
					amount of solid matter and large proportion of voids (gas or
					air bubbles, not large enough to carry heat by convection)
					have the lowest thermal conductivities .{" "}
